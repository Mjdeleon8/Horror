              On the night of December 16, 2023, the first day of the morning
              Mass, I woke up at 3:40 am to prepare for church. By 3:55 am, I
              was ready to leave. As I stepped outside, before locking the gate,
              I noticed a peculiar scent in the airâ€”it resembled the fragrance
              of sampaguita.
            </p>
            <p class="paragh-2">
              Curious, I took a few steps and then paused. I felt an eerie
              sensation, as if someone or something was watching me from the top
              of the house. Unsure whether to proceed or stay back, I hesitated.
              Despite my apprehension, I decided to continue walking.
            </p>
            <p class="paragh-3">
              While walking, it felt as though an invisible force was touching
              my face. The lingering scent of sampaguita continued to follow me,
              intensifying my fear. However, I pressed on. After about three
              minutes of walking, I encountered a group of people engaged in
              drinking, and suddenly, the sampaguita scent vanished. That
              concludes the unsettling experience.
